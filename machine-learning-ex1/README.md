### Programming Assignment 1: Linear Regression

In this exercise, we first perform linear regression with
one feature. We then perform linear regression with multiple
features. For linear regression with multiple features, 
we first do feature scaling and then perform 
gradient descent. Lastly, we compare the predictions from
gradient descent to the predictions from the Normal equations
for consistency.
